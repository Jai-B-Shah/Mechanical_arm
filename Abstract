Mechanical Arm
The presentation explains the design and development of a low-cost gesture-controlled mechanical arm using a linear actuator. The main aim of the project is to design an affordable and efficient mechanical arm that can be controlled through human hand gestures to perform precise lightweight lifting and object manipulation, especially for assistive and healthcare applications. The system works by capturing hand gestures using an MPU6050 sensor and a potentiometer mounted on a glove. These gesture inputs are processed by an Arduino UNO, which acts as the main controller of the system. Based on the processed sensor data, the Arduino generates appropriate control signals using PWM to drive the motors through a motor driver. Servo motors are used for joint movement and gripping actions, while a linear actuator is used to achieve accurate linear motion for lifting. The project uses Embedded C/C++ programming through the Arduino IDE along with supporting libraries to interface sensors and control motors. The overall system is tested for accuracy, load-handling capability, and reliable response to gestures, demonstrating a simple, economical, and effective solution for gesture-based mechanical arm control.
